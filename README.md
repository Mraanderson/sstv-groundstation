# SSTV Groundstation 2.0

A Flaskâ€‘based web application for managing and displaying decoded SSTV (Slow Scan Television) images, satellite pass predictions, and configuration settings. CLI for headless Debian devices.

## âš¡ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mraanderson/sstv-groundstation.git
cd sstv-groundstation
python -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```
The app will start on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## ðŸ“‚ Branch Structure

- **archive-layout** â€” Frozen copy of the original application layout (readâ€‘only reference).  
- **main** â€” Clean slate for the 2.0 rebuild, with modular features and improved structure.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Option 1 â€” Manual Setup

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mraanderson/sstv-groundstation.git
   cd sstv-groundstation
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**  
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
   The app will start on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### Option 2 â€” SSTV Groundstation Setup Script

The `SSTV.sh` script provides a quick way to set up and run the SSTV Groundstation app on a Debian server or similar environment.

When you run it, youâ€™ll see a menu with three options:

1. **Clear & clone the `main` branch** from GitHub  
2. **Clear & clone from a list of all remote branches** (numbered selection)  
3. **Run from the current folder** (only if it already exists locally)  

After your choice, the script will:

1. Remove the existing local copy (if you chose a clone option)  
2. Clone the selected branch from GitHub (unless you skipped)  
3. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (if not already present)  
4. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`  
5. Launch the Flask app so itâ€™s accessible on your network  

#### ðŸ›  How to Use

1. Save the script as `SSTV.sh` in your preferred location.  
2. Make it executable:  
   ```bash
   chmod +x SSTV.sh
   ```  
3. Run it:  
   ```bash
   ./SSTV.sh
   ```  
4. Follow the onâ€‘screen menu to choose your branch or run mode.  

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The branch list option is useful if you canâ€™t remember the exact branch name â€” it will query GitHub and let you pick from the available branches.

## ðŸ›  Features

- **Gallery** â€” Displays decoded SSTV images with live refresh.  
- **Config** â€” View and update location/timezone configuration.  
- **Passes** â€” Satellite pass prediction (placeholder in current build).  
- **Settings** â€” Import/export configuration files.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- The `images/` and `tle/` folders are tracked with `.gitkeep` so they exist even when empty.  
- All features are modular blueprints for easier maintenance and scaling.
- Designed to be contained in a single folder that can be easily removed if no longer required.

## ðŸ™Œ About & Credits

This project has been a true collaboration between:

- **Mraanderson** â€” The driving force and visionary behind the SSTV Groundstation 2.0 rebuild. Coming into this with little to none Python coding experience, learning everything stepâ€‘byâ€‘step, and steering the projectâ€™s goals and features.  
- **Microsoft Copilot** â€” Acting as a patient, persistent coâ€‘pilot throughout the build, explaining concepts, writing code, troubleshooting issues, and structuring the project so itâ€™s maintainable and expandable.  

From the very first commit to the latest feature, this has been a journey of turning ideas into a working, modular application â€” proving that with the right guidance, you donâ€™t need to start as a coder to build something powerful.
