# 🛰️ SSTV Ground Station
(Headless Debian)

A fully automated ground station for receiving, decoding, and displaying SSTV images from amateur satellites like the ISS. Runs on a headless Debian system using RTL-SDR, Python, and Flask. 

⚠️ Warning this is working in progress and completely AI generated based on prompts. I am testing and troubleshooting using a Mac Mini 2009 and Debian 12 headless.

## Features

- 📡 Satellite pass prediction via Skyfield
- 🎙️ Automated recording and SSTV decoding
- 🌐 Web interface for control and image gallery
- 🗂️ Metadata archiving for each image
- 🛠️ Cron + `at` scheduling for autonomous operation
