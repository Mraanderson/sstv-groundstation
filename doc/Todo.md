 finish wiring waterfall snapshot into manual recorder

 Recommended Logic Improvements for Better Efficiency
Cache and Incrementally Update the Recordings List

Right now, every /recordings/ request does a full RECORDINGS_DIR.rglob("*") walk, reads and parses WAV headers, JSON files, and log/text files. On large collections this I/O and parsing can become a major bottleneck. Instead:

Maintain an in-memory cache keyed by file path + modification time.

On each request, scan only for files whose mtime changed since the last cache build.

Merge deltas into your cached list rather than rebuilding from scratch.

Invalidate or clear the cache on manual file‐system mutations (e.g. delete/upload).

Memoize Pass Predictions Instead of Reloading from Disk Every Request

Both passes_page() and /timeline call load_pass_predictions(PASS_FILE) on every HTTP hit. If that function re-parses a file and recomputes satellite geometry each time, it’s CPU-intensive. Instead:

Call load_pass_predictions() once in your TLE scheduler after manual_refresh(), store the resulting list in a module‐level variable.

Have your view functions read from that in-memory list, refreshing only when the background job updates.

Optionally expose a TTL (e.g. re‐load after X minutes) to handle edge cases.

Precompute WAV Durations and File Sizes on File‐System Events

Calling wave.open() for every new or changed WAV slows down listing. Track each WAV’s duration and size in a lightweight metadata store (e.g. SQLite or a JSON index) that you update via a file‐watcher (inotify) or when the scheduler detects new files. Your builder then simply reads stored values rather than parsing headers in real time.

Throttle or Combine Diagnostics Polling

Your diagnostics page polls multiple endpoints every 5 seconds (updateStatus(), updateSdrLight(), runDongleCheck()), each triggering Flask handlers that check disk free, pass status, orphan files, PPM, and SDR presence. This rapid polling can spike CPU and I/O on the Pi. Consider:

Bundling all diagnostics data into a single JSON endpoint so the client makes one HTTP request per interval.

Reducing the poll frequency (e.g. 10–15 s) since these metrics seldom change faster than human response times.

Switching to Server-Sent Events (SSE) or a lightweight WebSocket to push updates only when values change.

Lazy-Load or Paginate Long Tables and Galleries

If your passes or recordings lists grow long, rendering every row each time burns CPU and memory on both server and browser. Implement:

Server-side pagination with simple “Next/Prev” or “Load more” controls.

On-demand AJAX fetch of the next batch of rows.

Client-side virtual scrolling for very long lists.

Offload TLE Fetching and Pass‐Prediction to a Dedicated Worker

While APScheduler runs fetch_and_save_tle() in the app process, any network hiccup or Celestrak slowdown can tie up your main Flask threads. For greater resilience:

Deploy a lightweight worker (e.g. a separate Python script or Celery task) that handles TLE fetches, writes the file, and recalculates predictions.

Let Flask simply serve the latest outputs without any network or CPU overhead in the request‐handling path.

Centralize Timezone and Date Parsing

Each Jinja call to |datetimeformat invokes dateutil.parser.parse and constructs a ZoneInfo object. You can speed this up by:

Parsing and localizing all dates once in your Python view layer.

Passing fully formatted strings into the template so that Jinja just prints them.

Batch Small JSON Reads/Writes

Your load_user_config() and save_user_config() read and write the same small config file per app startup or user action. If you eventually let users tweak settings frequently, buffer writes in memory and coalesce them on shutdown or idle periods.
