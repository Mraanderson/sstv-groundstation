  <h3>About SSTV</h3>
  <p>
    Slow Scan Television (SSTV) is a method of transmitting static images via radio, commonly used by amateur radio operators and on the International Space Station (ISS). SSTV encodes images as audio tones, which can be received and decoded using software or hardware decoders. Common modes include Martin M1 and Robot36, each with different transmission speeds and image formats.

  <ol class="mt-2">
    <li><strong>📡 TLE fetch:</strong> Download latest orbital elements for ISS and other satellites.</li>
    <li><strong>📅 Pass prediction:</strong> Calculate upcoming AOS/LOS times for your location.</li>
    <li><strong>⏰ Scheduler:</strong> Queue jobs to start SDR capture at each AOS.</li>
    <li><strong>🎙️ SDR capture:</strong> Use <code>rtl_fm</code> + <code>sox</code> to record audio to WAV.</li>
    <li><strong>🖼️ SSTV decode:</strong> Resample to 11.025&nbsp;kHz mono, detect sync tone, and decode image (or placeholder).</li>
    <li><strong>📄 Metadata:</strong> Save JSON with pass info (frequency, duration, ISS position, verdict) and file sizes.</li>
    <li><strong>🌐 Web UI:</strong> Display recordings, images, and status in the dashboard and info page.</li>
