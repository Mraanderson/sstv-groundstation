  <h3>About SSTV</h3>
  <p>
  Slow Scan Television (SSTV) is a method of transmitting static images via radio, commonly used by amateur radio operators and on the International Space Station (ISS). SSTV encodes images as audio tones, which can be received and decoded using software or hardware decoders. Common modes include Martin M1 and Robot36, each with different transmission speeds and image formats.
